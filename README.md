Created on June 10, 2018 to manage Netspective's Hugo based web sites

To start:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/netspective/netspective-hugo-starter.git (new site name)

Then, for custom branding for each site:

* Add a new logo  with name "main-masthead-logo-for-dark-bg.png" in static/images/branding
* Add updated CSS in static\css (name given is theme-custom.css)
* update themeVariant = "custom" in config.toml

NOTE: Theme was added using the following, but shouldn't be required for each site

    mkdir themes
    cd themes
    git submodule add https://github.com/netspective/hugo-theme-default.git netspective

**NOTE: If [source theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn.git) changes, be sure to merge in the changes to [our theme](https://github.com/netspective/hugo-theme-default.git). Like this:

    make check-theme
    make update-theme

Check out the Makefile and see its targets:

    make help

Use this to generate diagrams and graphdoc:

    make generate-diagrams generate-documents

Use this to clean up generated files:

    make clean
